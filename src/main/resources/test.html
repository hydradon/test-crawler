        Special counsel Robert Mueller's 22-month investigation was an often-shocking story about what Russians, Trump campaign associates and others did in the 2016 election so their preferred candidate could win. Now that investigation is complete. And the public, the media and Congress are anxiously waiting to learn what more, if anything, Mueller uncovered, and how much Attorney General William Barr will make public. Mueller's office has been notoriously silent, choosing instead to speak almost exclusively through court filings -- and with Mueller slipping out of his office unseen on Friday afternoon with no public statement to make and no more indictments to bring. The only public message, through a spokesman, was that Mueller would finish his service as special counsel "in the coming days" and that the office would be closing. However, what Mueller has revealed in court has already told the story of Russia's ambitious and brazen attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, the operatives who aided -- wittingly or otherwise -- in that effort, and the extent to which people around Donald Trump lied when faced with tough questions. Along the way, the special counsel charged 37 criminal defendants, interviewed dozens of witnesses and subpoenaed terabytes of documents, revealing that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton were far more extensive than previously known — and that multiple Trump associates were never as innocent as they claimed. What Mueller uncovered regarding the President's involvement remains a mystery. He has not brought charges against Trump or any of his family members, as some thought he would. He has not alleged a conspiracy to collude with the Russians.  Mueller also hasn't yet revealed what he learned about one of the key questions that has hung over the investigation: whether the President obstructed justice, first by pressuring then-FBI Director James Comey to go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in 2017, and then by firing Comey, which Trump later admitted was tied to the Russia investigation. There are still lingering, unanswered questions about what new information Mueller's team uncovered that didn't add up to a criminal indictment and thus remains shielded from public view. Mueller's team of prosecutors also uncovered alleged criminal activity that opened up a cascade of connected investigations and prosecutions from other sections of the Justice Department against Russians working in America, foreign lobbyists and even Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen. Some of these, like a probe into the Trump inauguration's donations and spending and another into Cohen's campaign finance violation of paying off women, continue to this day and will not end with the conclusion of the special counsel's investigation.   The next phase of the Mueller investigation could be a desperate political fight to provide details from the investigation to Congress and the public, one that could spark a prolonged court battle. But the special counsel has already exposed a range of revelations to the American public: — The dirty deeds of Paul Manafort are central to the investigation: Prosecutors made clear in court filings that the former Trump campaign chairman's ties to powerful pro-Russian Ukrainians ran to the "heart" of the collusion investigation and were not just about Manafort's lobbying business, including his continued contact with a Russian man accused of witness tampering and having ties to Russian intelligence. — The surprising start to the Russia probe: A relatively unknown campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, was thrust to the center of the collusion allegations after he was charged with lying to the FBI about speaking to a Russian-linked professor who told him about "dirt" on the Hillary Clinton campaign. His encounter with an Australian diplomat, in which he bragged about what he had been told, sparked the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 that eventually became Mueller's probe into collusion. — The many lies from Trump world: Despite Trump's initial claims that his campaign had no contacts with Russia, we now know of at least 16 officials who in fact had contact with Russians during the campaign and transition. Not only that, but the special counsel charged six people close to the President with lying about their contacts — raising the question, still unanswered, of why did they lie?   — Russia's sophisticated operation: Mueller's filings provided painstaking detail about how Russia's election interference went well beyond hacking Democrats and included a sophisticated social media propaganda effort that, allegedly, was ultimately backed by the Russian government. The Justice Department, in additional court filings, has now alleged that subversion effort continues on social media sites to this day.     This is a retelling of how Mueller's work played out and what the special counsel found.   Papa-Who? It was almost six months before Mueller made his first public moves. When he did, the cases put the investigation further into the Trump campaign than many had expected, thanks to a surprise indictment of a little-known figure. Mueller's first charges alleged a broad criminal lobbying business scheme for Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, an accusation that was widely expected. Manafort had long been on the shortlist of targets with various witnesses walking in and out of the federal courthouse in Washington to testify against him to a grand jury in the months before Mueller made a move. The indictment, once public, only alleged Manafort and Gates committed crimes before the Trump campaign began. The White House seized on the timeframe. The President tweeted that day "there is NO COLLUSION!"   But while Trump was crowing about no collusion, Mueller later that day announced another criminal case against a little-known campaign adviser named George Papadopoulos. As revealed in the plea documents, Papadopoulos, a 20-something from Chicago, heard that the Russians had "dirt" on Clinton early in 2016, then lobbied campaign officials to arrange a meeting with the Russian government — maybe even one between Trump himself and Vladimir Putin, according to court documents. Papadopoulos then lied to investigators about his interactions with a woman claiming to be related to Putin and to a mysterious Russia-linked foreign professor. The announcement of Papadopoulos' case was such a left turn the special counsel's spokesman misspelled his last name when the office first announced his plea. (It was corrected days after the unsealing.) Trump and associates downgraded Papadopoulos' role on the Trump campaign's foreign policy team, calling him a "coffee boy," and his significance in the investigation wasn't made clear.   But the transcript of that plea hearing shows that the Mueller team dropped the first clue of what was to come. "There's a large-scale ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part," prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky said in court. Manafort and Gates With Papadopoulos' charge revealed and his sentencing put on hold, the public focus quickly shifted back to Manafort and Gates. The pair vowed to fight their charges of money laundering, tax crimes and foreign lobbying violations. Both were placed on house arrests, and the government seized their passports. A day after their arrests, on Halloween, Mueller outlined how much more he knew about the two top-level political men. The two had connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, traveled extensively abroad, moved money through offshore accounts and hid millions of dollars acquired through off-the-books Ukrainian political work. But how did the past transgressions of the former Trump campaign chair and the deputy chair fit in to Mueller's attempt to find the truth of the 2016 presidential election? For months, Mueller wouldn't say. Instead, he turned his attention to others who had also always been suspected to be in the middle of the probe. Flynn and the Russians Next up was Michael Flynn. On Dec. 1, 2017, the former lieutenant general and Trump national security adviser on the campaign and, briefly, in the White House strode into a packed federal courtroom with an entourage of family members and lawyers. He pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about several things, namely his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Trump presidential transition. The pair had discussed over a series of phone calls the US position toward economic sanctions on Russia and the Russian response.

        READ: Flynn charges and plea agreement here   Sanctions have long been a thorn in the US-Russia relationship, and with Flynn's case in place, Mueller had found a motivation that later became a theme among some Trump associates' contacts with Russia. Mueller had learned Flynn was in touch with officials on the Trump transition team about his calls with Kislyak. While Flynn and Kislyak were exchanging phone calls, Trump associates at the President-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over Christmas and New Year's 2016, Mueller said, and kept in touch with Flynn. At this point, Mueller's cases against Flynn and Papadopoulos pointed to moments on the campaign and transition. Other top advisers around Trump knew about the interactions on Russia. Still, Mueller had no "collusion" to detail. The 13 Russians By February 2018, Mueller had his next big case to drop. The special counsel's Office introduced to the public a Russia-based company with an amorphous name, the Internet Research Agency. Mueller detailed in his court filings how the IRA, two other companies operating under the name "Concord" and 13 Russians allegedly executed an elaborate social media propaganda conspiracy in 2016. Some traveled to the US, got in touch with grassroots political operatives and campaign officials, then created fake online accounts to spread misinformation across Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. One of those Russians directing the operation, Mueller alleged, was a catering executive and businessman named  Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch so close to Putin he's often described as "Putin's chef." The allegations unmasked the extent to which misinformation had infiltrated the American political psyche, driving conservatives and liberals further away from one another. The Russians allegedly encouraged black voters to skip voting in the 2016 election, Muslim voters to demonstrate for Clinton, and Trump supporters in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania to rally. At one point, one of the Russian co-conspirators had an American hold a sign in front of the White House that wished Prigozhin a happy 55th birthday.   Concord Management and Consulting, the parent company of Prigozhin's catering business, was indicted in the case and has tapped a US law firm to fight the case on its beha
